        Located 72km north of Blantyre on a modern road, and 290 Km south of Lilongwe, Zomba is Malawi’s
        newest city.

        It is perched at the foot of the magnificent Zomba Plateau, hence the cool climate. The plateau is
        criss-crossed by streams, falls and still dams that cascade through the city.

        Zomba was the capital of the British colonial administration and independent Malawi up to 1975 when
        it was moved to Lilongwe.

        The colonial masters may have left many years ago, but their style of architecture is still evident
        in the city most notably Hotel Masongola; the old Governor’s Residence, old Parliament
        Building currently serving as the High Court, Gymkhana Club, among others.
