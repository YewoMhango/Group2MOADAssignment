# Group 2 MOAD-320 Assignment
## Introduction
You are called by the Ministry of Tourism to develop a mobile app for those touring around cities of 
Malawi. This mobile app will help users to know prominent tourist destinations.

## App Description
The app introduces basic information about Malawian cities to the user. You may include other 
content like description of well-known buildings and locations of well-known places in these cities. 
The app must have one activity and two fragments in such a way that when a user clicks on a city 
name in the top list fragment, the description appears in the second fragment. The app should use a 
bundle object to save data and preserve the current UI state so that it does not change when users 
rotate the device.

## Design Requirements
The mobile app should meet the following design requirements:

1. Use Linear Layout for main activity
2. Use list fragment for the top panel and a blank fragment for the bottom panel
3. All strings should be saved in ```strings.xml```
4. Use bundle objects to save state data to preserve the current UI state at orientation change.
