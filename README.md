# Group2 MOAD-320 Assignment
## Introduction
You are called by the Ministry of Tourism to develop mobile app for touring
around cities of Malawi. This mobile app will help users to prominent tourist
destinations.

## App Description
The app introduces the basic information about Malawian cities to the user. You may
include other contents like description of well-known buildings and locations of 
wellknown places in these cities. The app must have one activity and two fragments in
such a way that when a user clicks on a city name in the top list fragment, the description
appears in the second fragment. The app uses a bundle object to save data to preserve
the current UI state so that it does not change when users rotate the device.

## Design Requirements
The mobile app should meet the following design requirements:

1. Use Linear Layout for main activity
2. Use list fragment for the top panel and a blank fragment for the bottom panel
3. All strings should be saved in ```strings.xml```
4. Use bundle objects to save state data to preserve the current UI state at orientation change.
